            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>Denji, shaped by poverty and a lack of formal education, is brash, naÃ¯ve, and often rude, though he possesses a deep sense of empathy, especially when it comes to saving others. Despite his crude nature and limited intelligence, Denji's creativity in battle, like using fire to defeat Devils, showcases his resourcefulness. As a Devil Hunter, he is driven by base desires, particularly sexual gratification, and struggles with a fear of losing his humanity. Over time, his personality evolves, becoming more arrogant and obsessed with material desires, though his core motivation remains to improve the life of his adopted sister, Nayuta. Denji's traumatic past and complicated relationships, especially with Makima, leave lasting emotional scars, which he tries to cope with by seeking affection and a sense of belonging. Despite his flaws and misguided decisions, he matures into a more responsible person, showing care for those he loves, especially as he wrestles with his identity as Chainsaw Man and the internal conflict between his desires and moral choices.
